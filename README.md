# Quarto TWRI revealjs theme

*important:* not ready for use!

A minimal presentation theme for the institute.

## Use

```bash
quarto install extension txwri/quarto-revealjs-txwri
```

or if starting from scratch:

```bash
quarto use extension txwri/quarto-revealjs-txwri
```

This template is based largely on the Quarto ['clean' template](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean).
